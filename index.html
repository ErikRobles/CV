        <h2>Web Developer and Educator</h2>
        <p>Before studying to become a Front-End web developer, I worked, and still do, as an ESL (English as a Second Language) teacher in Mexico City. I became interested in web development as a means of providing interactive online activities for my learners. I had dabbled in programming in my late twenties but began to take it in earnest in the second half of 2017. My goal as a developer is to work towards the development of online education systems.

            <p>After Finishing High School, I went into the work force looking for a carreer that suited me. As I am auto-didactic, I concentrated my efforts on learning a trade. I spend a good number of years as the owner of a small carpet and vinyl installation company.</p><br>
            
            <p>Ready for a carreer change, I removed myself from the installation industry and began to study in order to become an English Teacher. As I have always been intrested in technology, I decided to put my auto-didactic skills to use and learn programming with the hopes of providing an engaging user experience for learners around the world wanting to learn a new language.</p><br>
                
            <p>I finished my Front-End Development track with Treehouse in December of 2018 and continue to study in order to become the best I can be.</p>
